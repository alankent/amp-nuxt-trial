# amp-nuxt-trial

Building up an AMP demo using Nuxt. This is still very much a work in progress (not fully working).

The main page is currently 'main.vue' which you access via http://localhost:3000/main.

The main directories of interest are 'pages' and 'components' which are referenced from pages.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
